# Slack Wbhook Service

This application is a simple webhook service for GitBook that post notifications to Slack.

#### How to use it?

1. Create an `incoming-webhook` integration in slack.
2. You'll get an url like `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`
3. Create a webhook in your book with `https://slack-service.gitbook.com/hook/v1/T032H76MF/B0DR4R4US/SBdsOaiWfAfX57DNbgZ5wdIq`
4. Done!
